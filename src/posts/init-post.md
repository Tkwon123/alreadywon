Hello World! Welcome to my website where I am looking to document some of the projects, thoughts, and learnings that I'm acquiring.

I created this website as an impetus for learning React (which you can [read about](#)), but it is also a response to an edict on [building terrible things](https://medium.com/@emmazhou/build-terrible-things-62c419d91db0). This website is a reminder that not all projects need to be great nor does everything need to serve an obvious purpose, but rather, that all progress needs a beginning and all learning lies in reflection.

Note that unlike other blogs, all writings are subject to change/edits because they are a personal account of my own evolution and thinking (which may or may not happen while I write code). Any edits can be found in the source code.

Here's to recognizing the limitless possibilities once the game is already won. Cheers!

Tim
