## 1-sentence overview

Author, Nir Eyal, provides ample research and studies in his "Hooked" framework of Trigger -> Action -> Variable Reward -> Investment, which provides an approach toward building habit-forming products.

## Takeaways

### Habits

Not all products can be habit forming.

> A company can begin to determine its product’s habit-forming potential by plotting two factors: frequency (how often the behavior occurs) and perceived utility (how useful and rewarding the behavior is in the user’s mind over alternative solutions).

An oft quoted expression in the investor community: "Are you building a vitamin or a painkiller"

> Painkillers solve an obvious need, relieving a specific pain, and often have quantifiable markets [...] Vitamins, by contrast, do not necessarily solve an obvious pain point. Instead they appeal to users’ emotional rather than functional needs.

While most investors and product managers seek to build painkillers, Eyal suggests habit-forming products have an emotional hook, deriving from creating intentional discomfort or unrest in end-users.

> A habit is when not doing an action causes a bit of discomfort. The sensation is similar to an itch, a feeling that manifests within the mind until it is satisfied. The habit-forming products we use are simply there to provide some sort of relief.

He further goes on to state:

> Emotions, particularly negative ones, are powerful internal triggers and greatly influence our daily routines. Feelings of boredom, loneliness, frustration, confusion, and indecisiveness often instigate a slight pain or irritation and prompt an almost instantaneous and often mindless action to quell the negative sensation.

His ultimate conclusion is that habit-forming products are both painkillers and vitamins-- they solve a real need, but they also satisfy an emotional urge to drive habitual engagement.

### Habit Loop

The habit loop is a four-step process to encourage habit-formation around a product.

#### Step 1) Trigger

Every action needs Triggers to drive the consumer behavior. Types of triggers include:

- **External Triggers** include paid triggers (advertisements, endorsements), Earned triggers (public relations, press coverage, viral videos, etc.), Relationship Triggers (referrals, word-of-mouth), Owned Triggers (app icons/notifications, newsletters)

- **Internal Triggers** are naturally arising emotional hooks, driven by the lack of congruity to be at a certain mental state

The author states:

> The ultimate goal of a habit-forming product is to solve the user’s pain by creating an association so that the user identifies the company’s product or service as the source of relief.

#### Step 2) Action

Triggers should spurn action.

> To initiate action, doing must be easier than thinking. Remember, a habit is a behavior done with little or no conscious thought. The more effort—either physical or mental—required to perform the desired action, the less likely it is to occur.

Actions require both _motivation to perform the action_ and _ability to complete the desired action_.

**Motivation** - Factors driving humans motivation include pleasure-seeking and pain-avoiding behavior; seeking hope and avoiding fear; and the ability to seek social acceptance and avoid rejection.

**Ability** - The friction or challenge it takes to complete any action. There are six dimensions to actions: time, money, physical effort, brain cycles, social deviance, and non-routineness. Ability is dependent on users and their context at that moment.

The goal should be to focus on simplicity as a function of the user’s scarcest resource at that moment. Identifying _what_ the user is missing, and then _what is making it difficult_ to complete the action will help product-designers encourage habit formation.

#### Step 3) Variable Reward

Rewards are less about the actual reward being provided, but moreso about the _need_ to reduce or alleviate the mental stress or cognitive dissonance. The issue with rewards is over time, they become routine and less rewarding. As Eyal suggests:

> Experiences with finite variability become less engaging because they eventually become predictable.

Product-designers can increase this need or desire by creating randomness and variability in the reward or payoff.

Types of rewards include Rewards of the "Tribe" (social), "Hunt" (acquisition, curiosity), and "Self" (completion, mastery).

#### Step 4) Investment

Product-designers can keep users engaged through the anticipation of rewards in the future.

The product improves the more it is used.

> The more users invest time and effort into a product or service, the more they value it. [...] there is amble evidence to suggest that our labor leads to love.

The primary forms of user investments consists of the following:

- Sunk costs - People have an irrational tendency to overvalue our own effort/work
- Cognitive dissonance - We try to be consistent with past behaviors or beliefs
- Stored value - The more information we provide, the more value something becomes

### Afterwards

Habit-formation isn't always intentional or obvious, but insights can be gleamed by loyal users. Once active users are found, product-designers need to understand the habit path formed by those users and amplify the different triggers, actions, variable rewards, and investments.

There are obvious ethical concerns related to the creation of habit-forming products. The author suggests the following framework to evaluate if habits should be formed around the product:

In restating the obvious message, product-designers can better gauge their own moral compass by creating products that improve can improve lives and they use themselves.
