# Table of Contents

# Background

[Previously](https://alreadywon.me/posts/upgrading-to-mdx), I talked about the features within MDX; now, I'm going to walk through some of the decision-making process and learnings along the way.

# Tools Used

## MDX Processing

- [NextJS](NextJS) - Framework for building React Apps
- [Next-mdx-enhanced](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced) - MDX processor

## Remark plugins

Remark plugins are markdown processors. A full list can be found [here](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md). The one's I used were:

- [Emoji](https://github.com/rhysd/remark-emoji) :v: - for markdown emoji processing
- [Image](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-images) (and imageWrap) - to allow linking of images in markdown files
- [ToC](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-toc) - to summarize headings as a Table of Contents

## Rehype plugins

Rehype is a pre-processor for HTML. It's not quite clear to me the performance benefits of processing via Markdown vs HTML (many of the plugins overlap), but these are the one's I found useful:

- [Slug](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-slug) - Add title headers for each of my markdown files
- [AutoLink Headings](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings) - Add clickable title headers

# Discussion and Learnings

## Processor

The official [MDX site](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/next) provides a solid processor for NextJS, but after having implemented it, I realized initial shortcomings. Each MDX file _was_ the page, thereby prohibiting any "higher-level" component from providing a consistent UI to the user experience.

I didn't want to have naked markdown pages-- I needed to wrap my MDX pages in a layout-- so I found next-mdx-enhanced which proposed an alternate solution of having a "default layout" that could wrap all my MDX files.

Previously, I stored all my posts in a /posts directory, and used NextJS to create the pages dynamically Within the application, I would now need to move all my .mdx files as _pages_ and then create a _layout_ directory that would serve the primary structure (these were previously in a _components_ folder).

```bash
# Folder structure

+-- layouts.yml
|   +-- index.tsx
|   +-- Layout.tsx
|   +-- Mdx.tsx
+-- pages
|   +-- posts
|       +-- this-post.mdx
|   +-- _app_.tsx
|   +-- _document.tsx
|   +-- home.tsx
|   +-- about.tsx
|   +-- contact.tsx
+-- components
    +-- AllTheWidgets.tsx
```

## Accessing metadata about the files

While the individual pages work, a top-level /blog page needs to be able to display all the blog components. While previously I had a [dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/dynamic-routes) to create all the blog pages, now with this new folder structure, each page was post... so I would need to do a little refactoring to create a top-level view of the posts and information no the tags). Most of this was already done in the NextJS quickstart, but I'm basically using `fs` to read the src/pages/posts directory for files, parsing the .mdx metadata (title, date, tags, etc.), and then returning the result to the Blog.tsx page.

## Customizing Components

Rendering markdown pages return plain-ol HTML, which then needs to be replaced by a React component. [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) made enhancing styles while maintaining headings seamless because of its [as prop](https://chakra-ui.com/style-props#the-as-prop), which "allows you to pass a HTML tag or another component to a Chakra component to be rendered as the base tag of that component along with all it's styles and props." To do this, I created a MdxComponents Component, which was just a mapping of HTML -> React Components (that render HTML).

```jsx
// MdxComponents.tsx (representative components)

export default MDXComponents = {
  h1: (props) => <Heading as="h1" size="xl" {...props} />,
  h2: (props) => <Heading as="h2" size="lg" {...props} />,
  h3: (props) => <Heading as="h3" size="md" {...props} />,
  // {...}
};
```

And imported these components via the MdxProvider:

```jsx
// Mdx.tsx

import MDXComponents from 'src/components/MdxComponents';
import * as chakraComponents from '@chakra-ui/core';

<MDXProvider components={{ ...MDXComponents, ...chakraComponents }}>
  {children}
</MDXProvider>;
```

# Last Thoughts

Settling on a final decision about some of these strategies took me a bit to figure out, but overall, I'm happy with the result.

It would be nice to have a way to have more targetted selectors when replacing components so that I could replace HTML tags under certain conditions (i.e. style the links of the body vs table of contents), but I haven't looked too much into it.

Also, at times writing MDX files feel a bit like magic. The ecosystem of plugins as well as embedded jsx makes certain behaviors _seem_ like they should work well together, but ultimately don't. For example, I would like to throw that `<Divider />` under the Table of Contents, but that doesn't work because we're trying to get plugins and jsx to play together.

I'll probably look more into this in the future when I have time, but this seems like a good start!
